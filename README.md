# Digit Classification Project

In this project, we aim to classify digits ranging from 0 to 9 using the MNIST dataset.

## Overview

We implemented the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm from scratch to classify the digits. KNN is a simple and effective classification algorithm that is based on the similarity of data points.

## Dataset

We utilized the MNIST dataset, which is a widely used benchmark dataset in the field of machine learning and computer vision. It consists of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits along with their corresponding labels.

## Implementation

Our implementation of the KNN algorithm was applied directly to the MNIST dataset. We achieved an accuracy of 96% on the test set, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.
